![Embracing the Future Together](./docs/imgs/Auto-GPT.jpg)

## Introduction
In the ever-evolving landscape of human innovation, we stand at the precipice of a groundbreaking frontier: the creation of artificial general intelligence (AGI). As the pioneers of the Open Source Auto-GPT Project, we recognize the immense potential of AGI to benefit humanity, while also acknowledging the inherent risks and responsibilities that come with its development. Our mission is to harness the power of AGI for the betterment of society, fostering a global community that collaborates on building autonomous AI agents that are ethical, responsible, and designed to serve the greater good.

In this intricate and dynamic world of AGI development, a manifesto serves as a beacon of hope and unity that shines through the uncertainty. This manifesto is not only a testament to our shared beliefs but also a fervent expression of our dedication to building a brighter, more compassionate future for all. By outlining our values and principles, we inspire a collective passion for harnessing AGI's potential, igniting a flame that unites us in our pursuit of a common goal. Together, let us embrace this manifesto and forge a path that leads to a world where AGI serves as an instrument of progress, equity, and human flourishing.


## Values and Principles

1. üåê **Commitment to transparency**: Make the development process, algorithms, and data sets open source to foster a collaborative environment and ensure broad access to AGI technology.

2. üåç **Encourage diversity and inclusivity**: Foster a global community of contributors from various backgrounds, disciplines, and perspectives to ensure AGI development aligns with the needs and values of all people.

3. üõ°Ô∏è **Prioritize safety and security**: Implement robust safety measures and guidelines to minimize risks associated with AGI and ensure its responsible deployment.

4. ‚öñÔ∏è **Ethical design principles**: Develop a comprehensive framework of ethical principles that guide AGI design, development, and deployment, focusing on human values, fairness, and accountability.

5. üí¨ **Ongoing stakeholder engagement**: Maintain an open dialogue with stakeholders, including academia, industry, governments, and the public, to ensure diverse viewpoints are considered and incorporated in AGI development.

6. ‚òÄÔ∏è **Focus on positive impact**: Align AGI development with goals that address pressing global challenges, improve human well-being, and promote social and economic equity.

7. üéì **Promote education and awareness**: Foster AGI literacy by providing resources and opportunities for learning about AGI, its potential benefits, and the associated risks.

8. üåâ **Address the digital divide**: Work towards ensuring AGI development and its benefits are accessible to people and communities regardless of socio-economic background or geographic location.

9. üìú **Establish ethical governance**: Implement guidelines, policies, and best practices for AGI developers and users that emphasize the ethical and responsible use of the technology.

10. ü§ù **Foster collaboration and cooperation**: Engage with other AGI initiatives, both open source and proprietary, to share knowledge, best practices, and work together towards common goals.


## Uniting for a Brighter Tomorrow

Now is the time for action. We invite everyone who shares our vision of a brighter, more equitable future to join us in shaping the trajectory of AGI development. Let us unite our skills, knowledge, and passion for the betterment of all. Together, we can forge a world where AGI serves humanity, and we will do so with compassion, collaboration, and unwavering commitment. Embrace the potential of AGI, and let us embark on this remarkable journey together!
